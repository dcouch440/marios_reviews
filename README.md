* Then after the process is completed use the command.
```
  cd (the file name that you saved it as)
```

* now open the project with

``` bash
code .
```
For windows users navigate to the database.yml file to set your username and password.

```
Setup postgresql for rails

	???? config > ???? database.yml
        default: &default
          adapter: postgresql ??????
          encoding: unicode
          pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>
          username: (username here) ??????
          password: (password here) ??????

```
* If you wish to keep these private you can also use a credentials password
* See this link to learn how to do so. ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHgvPPr2nLE )
  
* Start off by deleting your credentials.yml.enc file and master.key (within config folder) in order to generate another

```
  For vs code users try (within the terminal)
  EDITOR="code --wait" rails credentials:edit
```

* Within the file add

```
  pg_database_username: add username here
  pg_database_password: add password here
```

* Then inside the database.yml (see description above) add (or uncomment)

```
  username: <%= Rails.application.credentials.pg_database_username %>
  password: <%= Rails.application.credentials.pg_database_password %>
```

* Thats all for credentials

* Within the main directory of the project create your databases with

```
rails db:create
```

```
rails db:migrate
```

* From here to start the server you will need to type in:

```
  rails s
```

* visit localhost:3000 to view the app


### Admin or user?

##### This app is set up to use from a user or admin perspective, each role will have different privileges.
* To make a Admin you will need to generate from the console.
* Start by entering in information to your terminal as such:

```
$ rails c


 ( wait for loading )



 ( from here you will see )


Loading development environment (Rails 5.2.4.5)
irb(main):001:0>


  Type these instructions out while replacing the '' with information you want.
  The admin variable should be set to true as seen below.
  The default will always be false so don't worry about that.


> User.create!(email: '', password: '', password_confirmation: '', admin: true)


  If things are set up correctly you should now be able to login from the email.
  Fallow along with error response instructions if things do not look right.
